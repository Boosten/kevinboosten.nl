Hello there 🙋🏻‍♂️. Time has come to write stuff down and try to share some knowledge!

### What to expect?

I don't know 🤷‍♂️, let's see what happens!
But I will try to share things that I'm working on.

I'm a front-end developer that primarily works with Angular, Firebase and all kinds of Microsoft services like Azure and AppCenter.
I like to develop web- and mobile applications with Angular and Ionic + Capacitor 🌍📱. So you can expect articles about these topics!
