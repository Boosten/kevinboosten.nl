The other day at work we shared some information about [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.js installation. My colleague [Joep](https://github.com/JoepKockelkorn) then mentioned a tool I did not know about yet.

Need to switch Node.js version often? Or just want to manage your node installation as a pro? Consider using [Fast Node Manager](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) ðŸš€!

And the coolest part: "_To automatically run fnm use when a directory contains a .node-version or .nvmrc file, add the --use-on-cd option to your shell setup._"

Quickly go and checkout the installation instruction to get yourself started!
